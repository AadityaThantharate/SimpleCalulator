# CalculatorVue3
This is a simple full-stack calculator app that I put together to practice my web development skills. It uses Vue.js for the front-end and ASP.NET Core Web API for the back-end, with Entity Framework Code-First for the database. The app allows you to perform basic arithmetic calculations and keeps a history of your calculations.
